The provided web server contained multiple serious security vulnerabilities.  My additions to the files included in this repo are an attempt to mitigate the issues.<br/>
<br/>
I have addressed all static analysis warnings, engaged in "defense-in-depth" best practices, protected against SQL injection, protected against XSS atacks, implemented rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks, and addressed information disclosure issues in the program's error messages.
